Welcome to Arazim Project's TAU Factor extension!

We store previous exam grade histograms and data (average, median, standard deviation) for your comfort to download at https://arazim-project.com/courses/grades.json.

You may also use [Dib It](https://arazim-project.com/dib-it), [Arazim Project's TAU Factor](https://arazim-project.com/tau-factor) or [TAU Search](https://arazim-project.com/tau-search) which utilize this information.

The current data was generously provided by TAU Factor (which sadly can't operate anymore) but new data is added by you, by using this extension.

**Important:** If you encounter any issues with this extension, please don't hesitate to reach out at our [contact page](https://arazim-project.com/contact-us) or via GitHub Issues. **The extension does not do anything without you clicking the buttons and choosing to do so.**

To upload histograms from the IMS, browse to https://iims.tau.ac.il and you'll see these buttons:

By clicking "×”×•×¡×£" you will send the course's grade histogram! ðŸ˜„
